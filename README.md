## In this project we are building & automating an ETL Pipeline where we Extracting Weather Data from OpenWeather, Storing in S3, and Loading into Redshift using Airflow

### Step 1: Extract Data from OpenWeather API

Use a Python script to extract weather data from the OpenWeather API. You can use libraries like `requests` to make API requests and retrieve the data.

### Step 2: Store Data in S3

Once the data is extracted, save it to an S3 bucket. You can use the `boto3` library to interact with Amazon S3 and upload the data as an object.

### Step 3: Set Up Airflow DAG

Create an Airflow DAG that defines the ETL workflow. The DAG will include tasks for extracting data, storing it in S3, and loading it into Redshift.

### Step 4: Task 1 - Extract and Store in S3

Define a PythonOperator task that executes the script to extract data from OpenWeather API and store it in the S3 bucket.

### Step 5: Task 2 - Copy Data to Redshift using Glue Operator

Define another PythonOperator task that uses the GlueContext to copy data from the S3 bucket to Amazon Redshift. This can be achieved using the GlueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog() method.

### Step 6: Define Dependencies

Set up task dependencies within the DAG. Task 2 should depend on the successful completion of Task 1.

### Step 7: Schedule the DAG

Specify the schedule for running the DAG using the Airflow scheduling options (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.).

### Step 8: Monitoring and Logging

Airflow provides monitoring and logging capabilities. You can use the Airflow UI to monitor the progress of your DAG runs and to view logs for each task.

### Step 9: Error Handling

Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms within your tasks. This could involve retrying on failure, sending notifications, or taking specific actions based on failure scenarios.

### Step 10: Scaling Considerations

Consider scaling aspects such as handling large data volumes, optimizing Redshift loading, and managing S3 storage costs as your ETL pipeline grows.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create an ETL pipeline that extracts weather data from OpenWeather, stores it in S3, and loads it into Redshift using Apache Airflow and Glue operators. This pipeline ensures regular and automated updates of weather data in your Redshift database.
